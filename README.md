## :star2: :dizzy: Toolkit for Coptic and Ancient Egyptian  :dizzy: :star2:

# 0. preamble

* Made by [So Miyagawa](https://uni-goettingen.academia.edu/SoMiyagawa)
* Tools made in ruby etc. for So's work on Coptic Digital Humanities
* Feel free to use, but almost no documentation. It's really useful to convert texts made in old ASCII Coptic fonts into Coptic Unicode.
* Also, I did a contribution to recode_coptic.pl (https://github.com/somiyagawa/converters_perl/blob/master/recode_coptic.pl)

# 1. HieroJIS

* Youtube videos: 
  * [how to install HieroJIS]
  * [some examples of Word-to-Word Conversion]
  * [some examples of English Word-to-Hieroglyphs Conversion]
* description slides
    * GitHub: (https://github.com/somiyagawa/toolkitForCopticAndAncientEgyptian/blob/master/An_intuitive_unicode_input_method_for_an%20(1).compressed.pdf)
* It is better than Keyman on Windows, KMFL on Linux or Ukulele on Mac.
* Using Google Japanese Input currently, in the future it will use Mozc.
